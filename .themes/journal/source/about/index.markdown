Hi there! I'm Harry! This is a pretty shameless display of stuff my brother and I made: his photos, and my words and code. I work at Shopify as a software developer based in the lovely Ottawa, Ontario.

The things I enjoy most in life are good music, learning something I didn't think I could before, the feeling of flying, and poutine. Really mostly the last one there.
