Hi there! I'm Harry! I'm a software developer and otherwise fun-haver in the Ottawa, Canada area. I used to work at Shopify but I don't anymore.

The things I enjoy most in life are good music, learning something I didn't think I could before, the feeling of flying, and poutine. Really mostly the last one there.

I'm always happy to start a correspondence over email if you want to talk! You can reach me at [harry@harry.me](mailto:harry@harry.me). You could find me on Twitter as [@harrybrundage](https://twitter.com/harrybrundage) if you like, or Github as [airhorns](https://github.com/airhorns).
